# speedread.py

The aim of this project is to create a *very* feature complete, command line
program for "speedreading" similar to spritz. Although maybe "movie reading"
is a better description of what spritz does.

It is largely based upon

   https://github.com/pasky/speedread.git

but rewritten in python in preparation for feature creeping.

# Features

* Vim like key bindings
* Commands to repeat and skip sentences and paragraphs
* Commands to display large quantities of text
* Works in pipelines
* As many other features as possible

# Quickstart
